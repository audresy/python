Introduction:
1. nanoparticle_size_hist_BFS (Breath-first search method)
  Thermal annealed metal nanoparticles scanning by SEM
  Use Kmeans identify particles from SEM graph
  Use BFS method identify particle islands and count pixel number of each island
  Use matplotlib plot histgram of particle diameter vs particle number statistic
  
2. nanoparticle_size_hist_DFS (Depth-first search method)
  The recursion limitation problem happens due to too many pixel data in the file. 
  After revising the limitation, error warning is still there
